# Pattern Printing Programs

This repository contains various programs for printing different patterns in Java. Below is an overview of the patterns and the logic behind each one.

## Overview

### 1. Inverted and Rotated Half Pyramid
- **Description:** Prints an inverted and rotated half pyramid.
- **Logic:** 
  - Use three loops: one for rows, one for spaces, and one for stars.
  - As rows increase, stars increase and spaces decrease, creating the pattern.

### 2. Floyd's Triangle
- **Description:** Prints Floyd's Triangle.
- **Logic:**
  - Use two loops: one for rows and one for values within each row.
  - Print sequential values in a triangular format, incrementing by one each time.

### 3. 0-1 Triangle
- **Description:** Prints a 0-1 Triangle.
- **Logic:**
  - Use two loops and conditional statements.
  - Alternate starting values (1 for odd rows, 0 for even rows), toggling between 0 and 1 for each position to create the pattern.

### 4. Hollow Rectangle
- **Description:** Prints a hollow rectangle pattern.
- **Logic:**
  - Use nested loops to print rows and columns.
  - Print stars on the border and spaces inside, creating a hollow effect.

### 5. Butterfly Pattern
- **Description:** Prints a butterfly pattern.
- **Logic:**
  - Use loops to print the upper and lower wings separately.
  - Each wing is created by printing stars, spaces, and stars in each row.

### 6. Inverted Half Pyramid with Numbers
- **Description:** Prints an inverted half pyramid with numbers.
- **Logic:**
  - Use nested loops to print rows and numbers.
  - Decrease the number of printed values with each row, creating an inverted pyramid effect.
